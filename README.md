# Plant Disease Detection System

This project is an interactive web application for detecting plant diseases from images of plant leaves. It leverages deep learning techniques to classify images into different disease categories, providing users with accurate diagnoses and information about the detected diseases and their treatments.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of plant leaves to be analyzed.
- **Disease Classification**: Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into healthy or diseased categories.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides real-time predictions and confidence scores.
- **Educational Content**: Offers information about identified diseases and recommended actions.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Programming language used for machine learning model development and application backend.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks for building, training, and deploying deep learning models.
- **Streamlit**: Open-source app framework used to create interactive web applications.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Python imaging library for image processing tasks.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.

## Dataset

The model is trained using the [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease), a comprehensive collection of images featuring various plant species and their associated diseases.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
   cd plant-disease-detection
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Dataset:**
   - Download the PlantVillage Dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Train the Model:**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Open the Application:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.
